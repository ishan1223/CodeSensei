## üé§ Demo Talking Points

### Opening (30 seconds)
"CodeSensei is an AI-powered Chrome Extension that provides contextual, non-spoiler hints to coding platform users. It combines the power of modern LLMs with intelligent problem analysis to create a personalized learning experience."

### Problem Analysis (1 minute)
"The extension automatically detects coding problems and extracts key information like title, difficulty, and description. It then uses AI to categorize the problem and generate a structured analysis that helps users understand the approach without revealing the solution."

### Progressive Hints (2 minutes)
"Our hint system is designed to guide users step by step. Each hint builds on the previous one, starting with problem understanding, moving to approach strategy, and finally implementation details. This ensures users learn the reasoning process, not just memorize solutions."

### Debug Assistant (2 minutes)
"When users get stuck with their code, they can paste it into our debug assistant. The AI analyzes the code, identifies common mistakes, and provides specific debugging tips without giving away the complete solution. This helps users develop debugging skills."

### Learning Analytics (1 minute)
"CodeSensei tracks user progress and provides insights into learning patterns. Users can see their daily activity, hint usage, and problem-solving statistics. This helps identify strengths and areas for improvement."

### Technical Architecture (1 minute)
"The system consists of a Chrome Extension frontend, Node.js backend with Express, MongoDB for data persistence, and integration with Gemini or OpenAI APIs. The architecture is designed for scalability and real-time performance."

## üêõ Troubleshooting Demo Issues

### Backend Not Responding
- Check if server is running: `ps aux | grep node`
- Verify port 3000 is not blocked
- Check MongoDB connection
- Review API key configuration

### Extension Not Loading
